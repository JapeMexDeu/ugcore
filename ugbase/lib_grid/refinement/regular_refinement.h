/**
 * Selected faces will be refined with regular refinement.
 * Faces which are adjacent to selected faces or selected edges and
 * which are not selected, will be refined too to build a closure.
 * In this case however, the refinement is not regular - faces are
 * refined in a way to avoid hanging nodes.
 *
 * Pass a grid and a selector (which is working on the grid). The
 * provided aInt is required by the algorithm to store temporary
 * values. You have to pass it to the algorithm to allow
 * maximal speed for repeated small refinements.
 * 
 * All involved geometric objects will be selected after the method
 * terminated (This includes vertices adjacent to selected edges and faces).
 *
 * aInt has to be attached to the edges of the grid.
 *
 * If you are interested in rare, big refinements, you may also use
 * the overloaded version of Refine, which only takes a Grid and a 
 * Selector.
 *
 * If 'useSnapPoints' is set to 'true' (default is 'false'), selected vertices
 * are used as snap-points. They play a role during refinement of quadrilaterals
 * and of volume-elements with quadrilateral sides.
