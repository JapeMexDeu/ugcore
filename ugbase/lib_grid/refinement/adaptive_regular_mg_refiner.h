///	Specialization of IRefiner for adaptive multigrid refinement with closure.
/**	The implementation is based on HangingNodeRefiner_MultiGrid.
 * Hanging nodes are most likely present in the resulting grids, even though
 * they should not be used by discretizations etc. Their sole purpose is to
 * allow efficient grid adaption
 *
 * \todo	The current implementation has a performance overhead, since currently
 * 			all closure elements are removed prior to grid adaption. This should be
 * 			reduced to only remove closure elements which are affected by adaption.
 * 			One could therefore replace Selector by BoolMarker and adjust the
 * 			collect_objects_for_refinement / coarsening routines to use callbacks
 * 			when identifying valid refine / coarsen objects.
