/**	Used to steer the mark-adjustment process in classes derived from IRefiner.
 * Instances can be registered at IRefiner and are then used to mark new elements
 * based on already marked elements. Different specializations can thereby implement
 * different rules (e.g. for parallel refinement or anisotropic refinement).
 * The different specialization should be constructed orthogonal to each other,
 * so that they can be chained.
 *
 * The callback-methods 'ref_marks_changed' and 'coarsen_marks_changed' are called
 * with lists of elements which have been marked since the last adjustment-round.
 * The callbacks can then use IRefiner::mark to adjust marks as required.
 * If a callback changes a ref-mark on an element,
 * this will automatically trigger a new round of adjustments
 * (then only considering elements which have been marked in the current round).
 *
 * Adjustment normally stops as soon as no adjuster marked any new elements.
