///	Adjusts vertex coordinates during refinement
/** The refinement projector serves as a base class for other refinement projectors
 * and serves as a simple linear projector at the same time. I.E. new vertices are
 * always placed at the center of their parent element.
 *
 * Internally, refinement projectors are implemented for 3d coordinates. Geometries
 * of lower dimension can still be treated since they are wrapped in a
 * IGeometry3d class. While this adds a small overhead it simplifies implementation
 * and usability considerably, since no additional template dependencies have to
 * be considered.
