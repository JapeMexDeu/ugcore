//	HangingNodeRefiner2D_IRN
///	Performs adaptive grid refinement with hanging nodes (DEPRECIATED AND UNSUPPORTED).
/** DEPRECIATED AND UNSUPPORTED
 *
 * IRN stands for "irregularity rule n", which intends to say that
 * an arbitrary number of hanging nodes may exist on each edge.
 *
 * Refines flat 2d grids (no multigrids) using hanging node refinement
 * with an arbitrary number of hanging nodes per edge.
 *
 * Most commonly you won't use this refiner, but the ug::HangingNodeRefiner_Grid
 * or ug::HanginNodeRefiner_MultiGrid, which only support one hanging node per
 * edge, but which are more robust and work in 3d as well.
 *
 * Initialize the Refiner with a grid or manually assign one later on.
 * by marking elements of the grid using mark_for_refinement,
 * you can define where the grid shall be refined.
 * A call to refine() will finally create the new geometry.
 *
 * Make sure, that you won't delete any marked elements from the grid.
 * Please note, that a grid, which was refined by this class,
 * will most commonly contain HangingNodes, Constrained- and
 * Constraining- Edges/Faces. Such a grid has to be treated with care,
 * since those elements are tightly connected and reference each other.
 *
 * You may specify a refinement callback which can be used to calculate
 * the new positions of newly generated vertices. You can specify it in
 * the constructor or through an explicit call to set_refinement_callback.
 * If no refinement-callback is specified, HangingNodeRefiner will
 * attempt to create a standard linear refinement callback for an attached
 * standard position attachment (ug::aPosition or ug::aPosition2).
