 * setting 'allowForTetsAndPyras = false', the resulting mesh will consist of

 *
 * \param grid		The grid whose surface triangulation will be extended to
 *					a volume mesh.
 * \param layers	A stack of rasters, defining the layered domain.
 * \param aaPos		vertex positions
 * \param sh		Element subsets will be assigned depending on the index of the
 *					layer in which an element is located.
 * \param allowForTetsAndPyras
 *					'true': the resulting mesh will only contain necessary
 *							elements to represent the individual layers.
 *					'false': For each layer in 'layers' a complete layer of
 *							prisms is generated. Individual prisms are then
 *							assigned to subsets depending on which layer contains
 *							their longest edge.
 * \param aRelZOut	(optional) Vertex attachment to which the relative height of
 *					each vertex will be written. This value will equal the layer
 *					index for which a specific vertex has been created.
