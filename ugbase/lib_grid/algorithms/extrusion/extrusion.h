/**
 * \brief Algorithms to extrude geometry
 *
 * Through extrusion on can manipulate an existing geometry in different ways.
 * It is for example possible to create a ug::Prism from a ug::Triangle or a
 * ug::Hexahedron from a ug::Quadrilateral.
 * The creation of higher-dimensional geometric objects is however not obligatory.
 *
 * Of course extrusion can be applied to multiple elements at once.
