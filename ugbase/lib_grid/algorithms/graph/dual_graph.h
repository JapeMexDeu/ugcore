 * The created dual graph ist described in the following form.

 * The adjacency-map holds indices to the adjacent
 * elements for a node. The indices in the adjaceny-map are ordered so
 * that first all adjacent nodes of the first node appear, then the
 * adjacent nodes of the second node and so forth.
 *
 * Let n be the number of nodes in the graph, m be the number of edges.
 * Then adjacencyMapStructureOut will contain n+1 entries (the last one

 * (edges are always bidirectional).
 *
 * please note that you'll find all entries belonging to node i in the entries
 * adjacencyMapStructureOut[i] to (but not including)
 * adjacencyMapStructureOut[i+1] of the adjacencyMapOut. 
 *
 * TIndexType has to be compatible with int.
 *
 * If you are interested in a list of the TGeomBaseObj in the order
 * corresponding to adjacencyMapStructureOut, you may pass a pointer to
 * an array of TGeomBaseObj-pointers through pGeomObjsOut. Make sure, that
 * this array has the size of grid.num<TGeomBaseObj>().
 *
 * If you are interested in the indices assigned to each element, then
 * pass a pointer to an TIndexType attachment to paIndex.
 *
 * TGeomBaseObj can be either Vertex, Edge, Face or Volume
 *
 * Through pgoc you can specify a subset of the grid which shall be put into
 * the graph. If pgoc == NULL (by default), the whole grid is used.
 *
 * If you pass a multi-grid to this method, elements will be indexed for level 0
 * first, then for level 1 and so on.
