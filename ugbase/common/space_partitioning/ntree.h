///	The n-tree class can be used to construct space partitioning trees of dimensions 1, 2, and 3.
/** The ntree class provides spatial partitioning through binary- (tree_dim=1),
 * quad- (tree_dim=2), and octrees (tree_dim=3). It is designed as a template class to
 * support both different types of underlying math libraries and also arbitrary objects
 * that shall be partitioned. The element type is specified through TElem. It
 * does not have to fulfill any concepts but should be lightweight, since it is
 * copied during tree creation.
 *
 * The tree furthermore features a common_data object whose type is determined
 * through a template argument again. This common_data object is passed to
 * traversers and traits. Required objects such as data-accessors can be stored
 * in this common_data object as required by a specialization of ntree_traits.
 * It does not have to fulfill any concepts in regard to the ntree itself.
 *
 * Usage:
 *	- Add elements to your tree-instance through the 'add_element' method.
 *	- Call 'rebalance' once all elements have been added.
 *	- Use traversers to query the tree for elements, e.g.
 *	  'Traverser_FindContainingElement', 'Traverser_FindElementsInIntersectingNodes',
 *	  or 'Traverser_RayElementIntersection'.
 *
 * \note	Whether a node is refined into child-nodes during 'rebalance' is
 *			determined by the 'splitThreshold' of the associated 'NTreeDesc'
 *			instance. It can be adjusted through 'set_desc'.
 *			Only if a node contains more than 'splitThreshold' elements, a split
 *			of that node will be performed. Default is 16.
 *
 * \note	Each tree has a maximum tree depth. It defaults to 32 and can be
 *			adjusted through the 'set_desc' method. If this tree depth is
 *			reached, the tree won't be splitted any further and a warning
 *			is printed. Note that a tree of this depth often results from a bad
 *			underlying geometry and may lead to performance issues.		
 *
 * \param tree_dim		Dimension of the tree: binary-trees (tree_dim=1),
 * 						quad-trees (tree_dim=2), and octrees (tree_dim=3)
 *						are supported.
 *
 * \param world_dim		Dimension of the space in which the tree is embedded.
 *						This primarily affects underlying mathematical structures
 *						(i.e. vectors). Please note that world_dim has to be at
 *						least as large as tree_dim.
 *
 * \param TElem			The element type for which the tree is constructed. It
 *						should be lightweight, since it is copied during tree
 *						creation. There are no special concepts that TElem has
 *						to fullfill.
 *
 * \param TCommonData	User provided data that is stored in the tree (one instance only)
 *						but not used by the tree. It is passed to functions in
 *						ntree_traits. The concrete type for TCommonData depends on
 *						the concrete ntree_traits that shall be used.
